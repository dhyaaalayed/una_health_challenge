## First Task
I created a jupyter notbook to clean and concatenate all dataframes into one dataframe.
I deleted all Nan values columns.
I created an id field for glucose and I made it incremental counter to be simple.
I added user_id field by taking the name of its csv.


## Second Task
The dataframe is only loaded once into the memory while running the project.
I used FastAPI because this framework is designed for API and it has docs UI to perform tests.
